         <h1>About</h1>

         <p>My name is Siddharth Tirumalai. I like to play all kinds of sports such as football, soccer, and even cricket. I also play video games with my friends. I mostly play a game called Fortnite. It is a top-rated game. One thing that calms me down is reading. It makes me feel relaxed, mainly because I get to read in my comfy bed. I also go to different types of classes. Such as a coding class known as Whitehat jr. They are very good at teaching how to code, so maybe everybody should join Whitehat jr. I also go to other courses, such as a Jayas Academy. I live in Aurora, Illinois. I am currently going into 7th standard, and I go to a middle school called Granger Middle School. It is a lovely school, and you can learn lots of things there. I am currently 12 years old. </p>

         <h1>My Favorite Books</h1>
         <p>I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I
             started to do it when I was four years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I
             kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read tricky words. I was happy.
             When I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read an action story.
             The first-ever action story I read was called Spy School. The story starts with Ben, who is kind of a nerd about math and his other subjects. Then when he gets home from his typical day of school, he finds a spy sitting on his couch. The spy told Ben that he worked for the CIA and took Ben into the field to train to be a spy. There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
             vocabulary words. Then I can further improve my English.
             I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it at home. I wish I could read different kinds of books because it might be very challenging. </p>

             <h1>My Work</h1>

             <p>The only work I practically do is my homework. I have to make sure all my tasks have been finished. I do go to different courses and do my homework. I have other assignments, such as my coding homework, reading homework, and math homework. Since it is currently summer, I don't have many tasks to do, so I go to summer school to learn complex math. For my reading homework, I guess I am pretty good. However, it doesn't mean that it is too easy. I would say that it is my level of reading. My coding homework is quite different. Since I have to create applications and various types of websites in my class, I would say it is pretty hard. I need to keep practicing, and then I will get better at it. </p>

             <h1>Inspiration</h1>

             <p>My parents inspired me to become a better person. I got inspired by my mom because she was my guru and knows everything about the subjects in school. She also knows a lot of math. My dad encouraged me by teaching me to code since he was an engineer. He is the guru of electronics in my house. Now, you may know how I got enrolled into Whitehatjr.
                 Without my parents, I couldn't have gone far in life. Other people inspired me. My cousin, Aman, was brilliant and super tall. He encouraged me to study hard and get good grades. My 2nd cousin, Vishu, was a genius and went into many competitions. She inspired me to work hard so even I could do the same. My little cousin, Arjun(Aman's brother), inspired me to express my talents. Because of him, I am now learning to sing and draw.</p>
